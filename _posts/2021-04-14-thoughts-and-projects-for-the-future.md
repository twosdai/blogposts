## Preface

Below I wanted to reflect on the past year and solidify some ideas I've been having on mental/physical health. I also wanted to start discussing a project I'm interested in sharing in a development blog sort of fashion.

## Reflection

My last real [article](https://danielwasserlauf.com/2020/03/28/covid-19-mental-framing/) was at the beginning of the novel corona virus outbreak. Between then and now the world and I have changed. In reflection on working from home and living during quarantine I've come to realize some truths about myself:

- Intense daily repetition and social isolation causes intrusive thoughts and eventually self destructive behavior

- To be truly independent we need to ask for help.

During the past fall and early winter I've gone through periods of intense isolation and repetition. Specifically I went months without really leaving my home except for food, and each day was spent doing the same routine of rolling out of bed getting on a computer, working, eating, and then sleeping. With some breaks to watch TV/slack-off, or as my parents would call it when I was growing up, "Vegetate." This cycle quickly caused me to have depressive behaviors. With nothing to break up the day, all of my daily actions would give me anxiety and I began to stress out over the smallest topics/details. Getting up and doing the same action each day became harder.

What finally broke my depressive cycle was varied social interaction, which oddly enough I wanted to avoid at all costs. Specifically I began speaking about my problems to those who I loved. Just talking about my issues and feeling truly vulnerable enabled me to brake me out of my rut. I know talking about personal issues and problems isn't rocket surgery. However, for me it's been a new skill to learn.

While growing up, I had an idea about what it really meant to be an "adult." I needed to be strong, independent, tenacious, and intelligent. While great traits to have they really miss the point. _Being an adult is best when sharing life with others, and insurmountable difficulties are inevitable._

I now understand becoming more mature is more like finding my childhood. **Empathy**, **humility**, **kindness**, and **thoughtfulness** are some of the first lessons I had during pre-school. I think I somehow lost them along the way, and in relearning I found out how to get back up.

## Future Projects

Some background first, I'm a software engineer by passion and trade. I really enjoy authoring programs, and solving technical problems. I want to try and let others into this world regardless of skill level to see what the process is actually like.

I've recently started a new job at a fantastic company, [Marklogic](https://www.marklogic.com/). Without getting into too much detail my current team has been using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). In my past work I hadn't really had to interact with Python in any professional capacity. I've done some small projects and I have a passing understanding of it, however I never really had to work with it deeply.

In a few coming articles I will explore an example project of creating a webcrawler from scratch.

This article will dive into my thoughts around education and some relation to our current socially distant lifestyle.



# Abstract



Due to the current pandemic of COVID-19, many people in the education system are forced to learn remotely and learn more independently.  While learning and expanding knowledge is the advertised primary mission statement of educational institutions; there exist other objectives and roles the education system plays. These additional roles such as stand-in caregivers, social indoctrination, and life preparation are being totally ignored or fundamentally changed. I believe social distancing allows us to now relook at what is the real role of the <em>institution of education.</em>  







# Body


First let me be clear, this is not an article or rant about the woes of how education is terrible. Nor is it _(hopefully)_ in the same vein as a get rich quick scheme commonly titled like "<em>I don't have a college degree and I make 1000000$ a minute and you can too if you sign up for my day-trading</em><strong> â„¢</strong> <em>course</em>" I want to talk about the value which the <em>institution</em> education provides, while calling out the maladaptive traits it pushes onto us. 



To start off by institutional education I specifically mean the American Western educational system which comprises pre-school to undergraduate college education.  For my background I don't have specific experience with higher education beyond undergrad. Much of these thoughts come from personal and anecdotal experience of my peers. 

The institution of education does cultivate real useful and valuable skills. Reading, writing, mathematics, science, physical education, musical education are used in some fashion each day for most people. Children then, who do not have this understanding <em>should</em> learn the classical arts and sciences and be competent in them. I don't think anyone is disputing this, please write me if you are, however these ideas are not taught in isolation, many times we learn lessons within lessons. Typically these take the form of social education. We learn group dynamics while playing the recorder, and we learn not to speak out during math class. Unfortunately social education of what is _ok_ or normal varies drastically between educators and school systems. We have some guidelines around what is clearly unacceptable however much is left as an exercise for the students and educators. Below I have provided a list of examples which highlight some of the maladaptive behaviors which are taught in our education system. 

* Clothing Choices and control of personal image  


* Extreme adherence to timeliness    

* Codified forms of thinking   
  * Some thoughts have a moral weight as to being good or bad.  
    
* Unequal praise and standards for students   
  * For some students they are expected to achieve certain results  


* Fetishizing Grades   
  * Typically these are the only indicator which determines success for students   
  
* Limited focus on student potential   

  * Students can _only_ go to college and certain ones are better than others  
  
* Limiting Educational choice  


  * Inline with _Codified forms of thinking_ we create artificial boundaries around topics and deem them not worthy of pursuing.  
  
  * Any non accepted western idea is considered morally bad without proper explanation other than _its different_   


_We are frequently praised for conforming and exiled for being different._

Not all social pressure create maladaptive behaviors and many of the lessons learned because our peers are genuinely beneficial to ourselves and our broader community. To list a few: 
* Politeness 
* Fairness in dealing with others
* Patience 

Unfortunately during our education, we are placed for extended periods of time into small/medium sized groups in the same physical space, with a single central, unquestionable, leader. In our in-person educational environment social pressure is frequent and unrelenting. We do learn how to be polite, but only at the expense of being skeptical, we learn the religion and culture of the current acceptable practices and are asked to share/forget our own past. Our system encourages us to ignore the flaws and problematic traits of our educators, ourselves and our peers. Typically authority figures will attempt to shield most children from most problematic behavior, but humans are not omnipotent. Authority figures cannot always be paying attention, and many people are not cognizant of their own flaws so why are teachers any different? My previous statements are not meant as a bashing of teachers and a call for them to do better. I firmly believe we are a product of our community and our system. I am as much to blame for the current state as the next person. These identifications are just meant to illuminate how we learn ideas and traits which need to be unlearned later.

Understanding how to grow empathy as a skill and teach social nuance is an extremely broad category. The forms of potential communication avenues which students can take has skyrocketed with the increase use of the internet, telecommunications, and ease of transportation. It is a real wonder to me why there isn't a broader effort given to directly teach students proper social hygiene. 



### Possible Improvements 

Before I dive into some potential improvements, I want to take a moment to further clarify I am not an expert in psychology. I don't work in education. I am only attempting to highlight some issues I view as major social problems which we can prevent. I think its important to brainstorm some potential solutions, and the below is just that, brainstorming thoughts and ideas. I encourage you to engage with the content and pick apart any ideas which don't fit with your view of life, feel free to email me with any suggestions or critiques.

I have some ideas on how we can be better and how we can learn from our current social isolation. Firstly we don't have great classes which deal with building empathy and directly teaching social nuance with students. Currently we teach some of the basics of sexual health to students, and provide them with a limited understanding of conflict resolution. I believe we need a curriculum which teaches self advocacy, social hygiene,  skepticism, understanding manipulative behaviors, personal risk management,  proper stress management, and deeper forms of diversity education.

<sub>The topics enumerated above are important for the health and growth of students precisely because in education we do not socially reinforce disclosing and dealing with problems in a healthy and constructive manner.</sub> 

Second, I don't think that grades should realistically hold the weight which they do. I think in aggregate they are a fine indicator on if a school is performing well at teaching topics to students. However they realistically should reflect little in terms of the individual. There are additionally other pitfalls of the overall letter grade, granularity is lost. For instance a student could do extremely well in calculus I, but fail at having a great understanding of trigonometry. Or be a great writer of technical documents, but fail at literary analysis. I'm not calling for the end of grades in general, they are just inadequate as a one stop shop for us as form of individual success. Furthermore, I don't believe failing a class is acceptable or desired. But the real understanding of how a student performed in a class needs to be more qualitative in nature. The combination of the following factors can be a more reasonable substitute for academic success. 

* Letter Grades 
  * With the understanding that the student will never see their overall grade, just their grades per assignment, and their overall grade will not be used outside of aggregations for indicators of school performance. 
* Written paragraph from the educator on their thoughts on how well a student grasped the material and any ideas for improvement/future goals. 
* Specific notes about Units where the student struggled and areas for improvement 
  

Third, decrease the amount of time students are _forced_ to be in close quarters with each other. With our current pandemic situation its clear that its possible to explore other learning avenues for students for their academic needs. Please don't read this as an advocation for increased distanced learning. I don't think video calls or online classrooms are the best place for students. I think the institution of education can look to lengthen the days the school is open for and have more shorter and smaller classes. Our attention span falls after 20 minutes within a lecture, all classes realistically should be under 30 minutes. In this system students don't need to be at school for as long to cover all their classes, they don't have to endure needless intense social interaction. This does mean that academic classes would take longer and we would need to think of more flexible solutions for extracurriculars and the additional support needed to run a school, such as custodial services and food services. 


# Conclusion (TLDR)

Institutional Education provides a system for us to learn and grow many skills. It serves as the foundation for our lives and governs many of our long term behaviors. Unfortunately many of our behaviors which cause us problems are learned in this same institution. Taught to us while we are off guard.
